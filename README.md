## 🚀 How to Run the Project

This project uses **JavaScript ES6 Modules**, so it must be served from a local web server.

### **Method 1: Python Server (Recommended)**
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/Breakout

# Start a local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8000
```

### **Method 2: VS Code Live Server**
1. Install **Live Server** extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select **"Open with Live Server"**
4. Browser will automatically open the game

### **Method 3: Node.js Server**
```bash
# Install a simple server
npm install -g http-server

# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/Breakout

# Start server
http-server

# Open browser to the provided URL
